title: DeFi Terms
---

The decentralized finance or "DeFi" industry can be overwhelming for newcomers. There is a veritable ocean of new concepts and vocabulary which must be absorbed by newcomers. At MANTRA DAO we think DeFi should be for everyone, and we do our best to make it accessible to as wide a range of people as possible. To that end, we maintain this list of DeFi terms and their definitions which may be useful to newcomers (and maybe to some of you veterans as well who just need a quick refresher!).

More coming soon...
