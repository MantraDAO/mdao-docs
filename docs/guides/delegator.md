Press the 'Start linking' button on your chosen delegator rewards asset.

You will need to be on the Binance Smart Chain network in your Ethereum wallet and have BNB to complete the cross chain linking proccess. You will also need a fractional amount of the native currecny of the linking chain (in the case ATOM, you need around 0.01 ATOM).

From the same address that you are linking and that is delegating to the MANTRA DAO node, send the exact amount of the native asset specified. This proccess helps MANTRA DAO know you are the controller of this wallet.
