## What is OM v2

OM v2 is the second version of the OM Token. It features important updates such as setting the maximum supply at 888,888,888 OM. It's easy to migrate your OM v1 tokens to OM v2. Just follow the step by step instructions below.

## How to Migrate to OM v2

### Open Migration App

Navigate to the [migration app](https://app.mantradao.com/om-token-migration) on the official MANTRA DAO app page.

If you haven't already, connect your wallet by clicking "Connect to a wallet" on the top right, and make sure you have your address which contains your OM v1 tokens selected.

Click "Migrate" to begin the migration.

### Make "Allow" Transaction

Click "Confirm" to complete the first transaction. This transaction allows the MANTRA DAO app to operate on your OM v1 tokens. 

*This example uses MetaMask. The process will vary slightly with different wallets.*
