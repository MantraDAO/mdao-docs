## What is MANTRA POOL?

### A decentralized lottery

Matra Pool is a decentralized lottery powered by OM tokens.

Each week five lucky users who contributed OM to the pool will win prize tokens.

The more OM a user contributes to the pool, the higher their chance of winning. 

### More than just a lottery

Whether you win or not, all MANTRA POOL participants win because they are helping to reduce the amount of circulating OM.

Soon contributing OM will also earn you KARMA. As members earn more KARMA they unlock KARMA rewards, including weekly free entry into all MANTRA POOLs and other benefits.

### Where do Rewards Come From?

Twenty five percent of all staking rewards from MANTRA DAO Foundation staked assets and validator nodes goes into MANTRA POOL. Occasionally additional rewards will be offered by MANTRA DAO partner projects, so you never know what you might win in addition to normal rewards!
