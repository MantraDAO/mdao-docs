## Introduction

*Note: As ZENTEREST's core mechanics regarding interest rates, liquidations, and more (except for governance) are based on Compound, please refer [Compound's documentation](https://compound.finance/docs) for more detailed explanations. For a detailed explanation of liquidations, [see here](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/liquidators-the-secret-whales-helping-defi-function-acf132fbea5e).*

ZENTEREST is a fork of both Compound Finance & Cream.finance, however, it will have its own unique set of listed assets, as well as an additional OM incentive distributed to suppliers/borrowers.

ZENTEREST offers an impressively wide range of assets to lenders and borrowers which the continue to expand. You can view the available 

This beta version will initially be launched with unlocked OM rewards starting next week on Monday, January 4th in order to attract LPs and increase the platform’s TVL (Total Value Locked). However, in time, these rewards will be distributed through a rewards distribution smart contract vested over an extended timeframe. Initially, ZENTEREST will be launched as an Ethereum-based protocol, but as we continue with our tech development and roadmap, we will look to bridge this product to other interoperable blockchains, such as the Polkadot ecosystem in order to allow a multitude of assets to be listed.

*Disclaimer: This project is in Beta. ZENTEREST contracts are a fork of Compound Finance & Cream.finance in its current form and hence are only as secure as Compound Finance’s and Cream.finance’s contracts and the underlying infrastructure. Users are advised to be informed and use the platform at their own risk.*
